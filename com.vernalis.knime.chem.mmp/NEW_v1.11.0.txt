All Nodes
 * Streamable

Fragmentation nodes (UPDATED)
 * Performance improvements
 * Memory leaks fixed
 * AP Fingerprint columns have properties describing creation settings to avoid mismatch
 * Graph Distance AP fingerprint vectos added
 * ID can now be the RowID
 * HiLite mapping optionally implemented
 * New Progress View
 * Pass-through of data columns
 * Rendering of fragmentation
 * Complexity filter
 * Behavioural change to remove explicit H's for 1 cut option
 * Additional option regarding incoming explicit H's

Pair Generation (UPDATED & NEW)
 * Performance improvements
 * HiLite mapping optionally implemented
 * Transforms can be filtered by Heavy-Atom-Count change
 * Transforms can be filtered by Graph distance similarity
 * Remove explicit H's from pair output no longer available as an option
 * Added option to require attachment points to be attached by single, acyclic bonds in SMARTS pattern
 * Pass-through, difference (L-R or R-L) and ratio (L/R or R/L) of data columns from left or right of transform pair
 * New 'Reference Table' version of pair generation node implemented, only returning transforms between the rows of the two input tables
 
Apply Transforms (NEW)
 * New node to apply table of rSMARTS transforms
 * Allows AP-fingerprint environment filtering
 * Node Views showing progress, including currently processed transform(s)

Rendering Nodes (NEW)
 * Show matching bonds (also calculates number of matching bonds)
 * Show cuttable bonds (also calculates number of cuttable bonds)
