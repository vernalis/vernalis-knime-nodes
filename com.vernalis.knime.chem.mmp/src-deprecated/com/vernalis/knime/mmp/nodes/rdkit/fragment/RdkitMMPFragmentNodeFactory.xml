        This node implements the Hussain and Rea algorithm for Matched Molecular Pair finding.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node implements the Hussain and Rea algorithm (Ref 1) for
				finding
				Matched Molecular Pairs in a dataset. The user can specify
				the
				number
				of cuts to be made (1 - 10), and whether Hydrogens should
				be
				added.
			</p>
			<p>The node implements the molecule fragmentation part of the
				process, enabling the fragmented molecule key-value pairs to be
				stored in a database for later recall
			</p>
			<p>
				A variety of fragmentation options are included:
				<ol>
					<li>"All acyclic single bonds" - Any acyclic single bond between
						any two atoms will be broken. This is the most exhaustive
						approach, but can generate a large number of pairs (rSMARTS:
						[*:1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*])
					</li>
					<li>"Only acyclic single bonds to rings" - Single acyclic bonds
						between any atoms will be broken, as long as at least one atom is
						in a ring (rSMARTS: [*;R:1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*]).
					</li>
					<li>"Only single bonds to a heteroatom" - Single acyclic bonds
						between any two atoms, at least one of which is not Carbon will be
						broken. Included to mirror C-X bond breaking chemistry prevalent
						in modern drug discovery (e.g. SNAr, Reductive Aminations, Amide
						formations etc. See Ref. 2) (rSMARTS:
						[!#6:1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*])
					</li>
					<li>"Non-functional group single bonds" - This
						reproduces the
						fragmentation pattern used in the original
						Hussein/Rea paper (See
						footnote 24, Ref. 1), and also used in the
						RDKit Python
						implementation (Ref 3) (rSMARTS:
						[#6+0;!$(*=,#[!#6]):1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*])
					</li>
					<li>"User defined" - The user needs to provide their own rSMARTS
						fragmentation definition, following the guidelines below.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Guidelines for Custom rSMARTS Definition</i>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>'>>' is required to separate reactants and products</li>
					<li>Products require '[*]' to occur twice, for the attachment
						points (the node will handle the tagging of these)
					</li>
					<li>Reactants and products require exactly two atom mappings, e.g.
						:1] and :2] (other values could be used).
					</li>
					<li>The atom mappings must be two different values</li>
					<li>The same atom mappings must be used for reactants and products
					</li>
				</ul>
				rSMARTS not conforming to these guidelines will be rejected during
				node configuration.
			</p>
			<p>Optionally, when only a single cut is made, or connectivity
				tracking is enabled, context-fingerprints can be generated (one for
				each attachment point). The fingerprints generated are RDKit Morgan
				fingerprints, rooted at the attachment point(s) of the fragment key
			</p>
			<p>The algorithm is implemented using the RDKit toolkit.</p>
