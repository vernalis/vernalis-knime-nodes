		<intro>
			<p>This node implements the Hussain and Rea algorithm for finding
				Matched Molecular Pairs in a dataset. The node takes an input table
				of fragments generated either by the MMP Molecule
				Fragment node and
				generates an output table of matched molecular
				pairs (MMPs)
			</p>
			<p>The node requires two SMILES input columns, representing the 'key'
				(unchanging atoms) and 'value', and a string column containing the
				ID. The node will attempt to
				auto-guess these column selections based
				on the default names for
				the columns output by the fragment node.
			</p>
			<p>The input table can contain fragmentations from differing numbers
				of cuts, in which case this will be reeflected in the output table.
				Input tables containing Attachment Point Fingerprints will be passed
				through, as will the 'Number of Cuts' column if present.
			</p>
			<p>Optionally, the user can specify that the table is pre-sorted by
				keys. If this option is selected, then the user can allow checking
				of the output for correct sorting, in which case, the node will fail
				if an earlier key is found again later in the table. This method
				uses less memory, as the entire input table does not have to be
				loaded into memory. For anything other than small datasets, the user
				is recommended to pre-sort the input table by key, and then use this
				setting.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any attachment point fingerprint(s) generated during fragmentation
				are
				passed through and attached to the appropriate transformations
			</p>

		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Select the Fragment Key column">Select the column containing the fragment 'keys'
			</option>
			<option name="Keys are sorted">Use this option if the keys column is pre-sorted.
				See above for details
			</option>
			<option name="Check keys are sorted">It is strongly recommended to use this option if
				specifying that keys are pre-sorted, in order to avoid missing MMPs
				from the dataset if a sorting error has occurred.
			</option>
			<option name="Select the Fragment Value column">Select the column containing the fragment
				'values'
			</option>
			<option name="Select the ID column">
				Select the column containing the parent molecule
				IDs
			</option>
			<option name="Ignore Molecule IDs when checking for uniqueness">When checked, if 2 identically-fragmented
				molecules
				are supplied with different IDs, transformations will only
				result
				from one of the IDs. This situation should only arise with
				non-canonicalised SMILES input tables, where possible duplicates
				have not been removed
			</option>
			<option name="Allow self-transforms">Allows two regioisomeric fragmentations of an
				input molecule resulting in identical keys but differing values to
				provide a 'self-transform' between the fragmentations

		<tab name="Output Settings">
			<option name="Remove Explicit H's from output">Explicit hydrogens will be removed from the

			<option name="Show number of changing atoms">The number of heavy atoms (not including 'A', the
				attachment point) will be included for Left and Right fragments

			<option name="Include Reactions SMARTS">In addition to the SMIRKS representation of the
				transformation, the transform is shown in an rSMARTS representation
				with atom mappings
