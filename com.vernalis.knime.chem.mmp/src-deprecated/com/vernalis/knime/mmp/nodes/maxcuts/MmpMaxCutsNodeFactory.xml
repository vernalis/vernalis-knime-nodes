	<name>MMP Calculate Maximum Cuts</name>

	<shortDescription>
        This node calculates the maximum number of cuts which a molecule can support with the given fragmentation method
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node pre-filtes molecules by viabilty in the specified MMP
				schema. The user can specify the number of cuts to be made (1 - 10),
				and whether Hydrogens should be added (for 1 cut only).
			</p>
			<p>
				A variety of fragmentation options are included:
				<ol>
					<li>"All acyclic single bonds" - Any acyclic single bond between
						any two atoms will be broken. This is the most exhaustive
						approach, but can generate a large number of pairs (rSMARTS:
						[*:1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*])
					</li>
					<li>"Only acyclic single bonds to rings" - Single acyclic bonds
						between any atoms will be broken, as long as at least one atom is
						in a ring (rSMARTS: [*;R:1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*]).
					</li>
					<li>"Only acyclic single bonds to either rings or to double bonds
						exocyclic to rings" - single acyclic bonds between any atoms will
						be broken, as long as 1 atom is either in a ring, or in a double
						bond exocyclic to a ring, with the other end in the ring (rSMARTS:
						[*:1]!@!=!#[*;!R0,$(*=!@[*!R0]):2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*])
					</li>
					<li>"Only single bonds to a heteroatom" - Single acyclic bonds
						between any two atoms, at least one of which is not Carbon will be
						broken. Included to mirror C-X bond breaking chemistry prevalent
						in modern drug discovery (e.g. SNAr, Reductive Aminations, Amide
						formations etc. See Ref. 2) (rSMARTS:
						[!#6:1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*])
					</li>
					<li>"Non-functional group single bonds" - This
						reproduces the
						fragmentation pattern used in the original
						Hussein/Rea paper (See
						footnote 24, Ref. 1), and also used in the
						RDKit Python
						implementation (Ref 3) (rSMARTS:
						[#6+0;!$(*=,#[!#6]):1]!@!=!#[*:2]>>[*:1]-[*].[*:2]-[*])
					</li>
					<li>"User defined" - The user needs to provide their own rSMARTS
						fragmentation definition, following the guidelines below.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Guidelines for Custom rSMARTS Definition</i>
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>'>>' is required to separate reactants and products</li>
					<li>Products require '[*]' to occur twice, for the attachment
						points (the node will handle the tagging of these)
					</li>
					<li>Reactants and products require exactly two atom mappings, e.g.
						:1] and :2] (other values could be used).
					</li>
					<li>The atom mappings must be two different values</li>
					<li>The same atom mappings must be used for reactants and products
					</li>
				</ul>
				rSMARTS not conforming to these guidelines will be rejected during
				node configuration.
			</p>
			<p>The algorithm is implemented using the RDKit toolkit.</p>
