		<intro>
			<p>
				This node appends plate and well IDs to a table. The user selects
				the plate size and fill direction. The node appends the following
				columns to the table
				<ol>
					<li>
						<tt>Plate Index</tt>
						- a numerical plate index, starting a 1
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>Well Index</tt>
						- a numerical well index within the current plate, starting at 1
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>Row Index</tt>
						- a numerical row index within the current plate, starting at 1
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>Row ID</tt>
						- an alphabetical row ID within the current plate, starting at 'A'
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>Column Index</tt>
						- a numerical column index within the current plate, starting at 1
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>Well ID</tt>
						- an alphanumeric Well ID combining the
						<tt>Row ID</tt>
						and
						<tt>Column Index</tt>
						fields, separated by the row-column deliminator. The node dialog
						contains a live preview for this field for well A1
					</li>
					<li>
						<tt>Plate/Well ID</tt>
						- an alphanumeric Well ID prefixed with the Plate ID, plate prefix
						and plate-row deliminator. The node dialog
						contains a live preview
						for this field for well A1
					</li>

		<option name="Plate Size">The plate size to use - pick one of the standard
			sizes
		</option>
		<option name="Fill Direction">Should the plate be filled row-wise (i.e.
			A1-A2-A3...An B1-B2-B3... etc) or column-wise (ie.
			A1-B2-C1...A2-C2-D2...)
		</option>

		<option name="&lt;Space&gt;-pad Row IDs">Should Row IDs be left-space-padded to the maximum
			width required for the last row of the plate in the Plate/Well ID
			column
		</option>
		<option name="First Plate Index">The index to be used for the first plate</option>
		<option name="Wells to skip at start of plate(s)">
			The number of blank wells to be left at the start
			of each plate, e.g.
			for a 96-well plate filled column-wise, to leave
			a blank column at the
			start, enter '
			<tt>8</tt>
			'. This value is between 0 and
			one less than the number of wells on
			the plate. Increasing it such
			that the first well to use is beyond the
			number of wells specified by
			the '
			<tt>Wells to skip at end of plate(s)</tt>
			' setting will result in that setting being decreased to ensure that
			there is always at least one well in use on the plate. If changing
			the plate size puts the value entered beyond the last well of the
			plate, it will be reduced to keep one plate well occupied
		</option>
		<option name="Wells to skip at end of plate(s)">
			The number of blank wells to be left at the end
			of each plate, e.g.
			for a 96-well plate filled column-wise, to leave
			a blank column at the
			end, enter '
			<tt>8</tt>
			'. This value is between 0 and the maximum value for the plate size
			such that at least one well is occupied, and may be changed by
			changes to the plate size of '
			<tt>Wells to skip at start of plate(s)</tt>
			' settings to ensure at least one well is always available
		</option>
		<option name="0-pad Column IDs">Should the Column index be 0-padded to the
			maximum
			width required for the last column in the plate in the Well ID and
			Plate/Well ID columns
		</option>
		<option name="Plate prefix">The prefix before the plate index in the
			Plate/Well ID column
		</option>
		<option name="Plate:Row deliminator">The deliminator character(s) between the plate
			index and the Row ID in the Plate/Well ID column
		</option>
		<option name="Row:Column deliminator">The deliminator character(s) between the Row ID
			and Column Index in the Well ID and Plate/Well ID columns
		</option>
		<option name="Label Format Preview">This field contains live-updating previews of the
			current format of the Well ID and Plate/Well ID columns for the well
			A1
