			lists

		<option name="Fail if no matching columns">Should the node execution fail if there are no
			matching collection columns?
		</option>
		<option name="Counting Options">Whether to include all cells in the collection,
			exclude missing value cells, or only include missing value cells
		</option>
		<option name="Unique values only">Whether all values are counted individually, or
			whether only unique values are counted. For Set cells, the results
			will be the same regardless of this option, as sets only contain
			unique values. All missing cells are considered equal, and so if
			missing cells are counted, then all missing cells will add only one
			to the
			total - in particular, if only missing cells are being counted,
			then the result will be either 0 or 1
