	<name>Mask Lists</name>

	<shortDescription>
		This node applies a mask (from a List column) to one or more list columns
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node creates a mask from a selected column, and only keeps
				the 'masked' subset of members of any selected lists. If the mask
				column is a collection of boolean cells or a BitVector cell, then the kept cells are
				those whose corresponding positions in the mask are 'true' (set bits in the case of a BitVector). If it is
				a list of integers, the mask is either those positions where the
				mask value > 0, or the list of indices within the list represented
				by the numerical values in the mask cell

		<option name="Mask Column">Select the incoming List column or BitVector containing the
			mask
		</option>
		<option name="Use values as indices">If the mask is a list of integers, then use those
			values as the indices. If this option is not set, then those
			positions where the value > 0 will be used
		</option>
		<option name="Treat missing masks as empty collections">If this option is set, a missing cell in the mask
			column will be treated as an empty collection, otherwise the row will
			be left unmasked
		</option>
		<option name="List Columns to Mask">The list columns to apply the mask to</option>
		<option name="Fail if no matching columns">Should the node execution fail if there are no
			matching collection columns?</option>
