	<name>Database IF Switch (Flow Variable Value)</name>

	<shortDescription>
        This node provides an IF switch which selects the active database connection port based on the comparison of a flow variable with
        a user-entered value.  The comparison method can also be selected.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro><p>This node provides an IF switch which selects the active database connection port based on the comparison of a flow variable with
        a user-entered value.  The comparison method can also be selected.  It can be considered to be broadly similar in function
        to the Java Snippet IF Switch node in the core KNIME implementation.</p>
        <p>If numeric variables (double or integer types) are selected, the node will attempt to process the user-entered value
        as a number.  If this cannot be done, then the node will not be executable.  An empty string will not be interpreted as a numeric value.  
        Note that integers can not be compared
        with values where a '.' is present, so '1.0' cannot be interpreted, but '1' can.</p>
        <p>For doubles, a threshold is specified in the dialogue.  If the variable is within this threshold of the comparison value
        it will be considered to be equal to it (Applies to =, !=, &gt;= and &lt;= comparisons).</p>
        <p>String comparisons are '<a href="http>//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order">lexicographical</a>' - i.e. 
        the sorting order mirrors that in which the strings would be expected to appear in a dictionary.</p>
        <p>If the comparison is considered to be 'true', then the top port will be active, otherwise the bottom port
        will be active</p>
