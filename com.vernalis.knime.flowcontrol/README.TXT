* Flow control (If / Case switch) for Flow Variable Ports
* Flow control (If / Case switch) for Database Connection Table Ports
* Loop end nodes for 3, upto 4 and upto 6 ports
* Timing loops, where the loop will run until a certain time has been reached, 
	or until a certain time period has elapsed
* Delay nodes, which will simply wait until a certain time has been reached, 
	or until a certain time period has elapsed
