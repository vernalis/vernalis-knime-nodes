		<intro>
			<p>Loop start node to chunk table into blocks and run until a
				specified time of day has passed. The user can
				specify the number of
				rows to process in each chunk, and the time (hh:mm)
				at which the last
				iteration will start
				before. The loop will execute until that time is
				reached, when no further
				rows will be processed. If connected to a
				Run-to-time Loop end, the unprocessed rows will be
				available directly
				in the final port of the loop end node.
