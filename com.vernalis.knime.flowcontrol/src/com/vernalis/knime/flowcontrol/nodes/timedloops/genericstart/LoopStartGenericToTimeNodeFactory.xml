		<intro>
			<p>Loop start node to repeatedly process entire input table until a
				specified time of day has passed. The user can
				specify the time
				(hh:mm)
				at which the last
				iteration will start
				before.
				The loop will
				execute until that time period has
				elapsed.
				If connected
				to a
				Run-to-time Loop end, the unprocessed rows table will be empty
				for
				this node as all rows are processed repeatedly on each loop
				iteration.
