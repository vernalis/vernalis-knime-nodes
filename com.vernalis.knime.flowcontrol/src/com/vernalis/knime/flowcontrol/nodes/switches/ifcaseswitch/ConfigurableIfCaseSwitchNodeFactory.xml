	<name>Configurable IF/CASE Switch</name>

	<shortDescription>
		A configurable IF/CASE switch with changeable port
		types and varying number of outputs
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			A configurable IF/CASE switch with changeable port types and varying
			number of output ports. Output
			ports can be replaced with Flow
			Variable ports where required.

			The active port is determined by the
			value of the selected integer variable with behaviour according to
			the node settings when the value is out of range, as follows:

			<p>
				<i>All</i>
				- All outputs will be active if the value is outside the range
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Fail</i>
				- The node execution will fail if the value is outside the range
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Modulo Reduction</i>
				- the value range is the remainder after dividing by the number of
				ports
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Nearest in Range</i>
				The first or last port is used if the value is beyond those limits
			</p>
			<p>In all cases, the range is either 0 - (number of output ports -
				1), or, if the 'Count negative values from end' option is selected,
				-(number of output ports) - (number of output ports -
				1)
			</p>

		<option name="Variable">The variable to use</option>
		<option name="Count negative values from end">If selected, this option means negative variables
			will be used to count from the last port downwards, e.g. -1 is the
			last port, -2 the second last etc
		</option>
		<option name="Out-of-bounds behaviour">The behaviour of the node if the variable value is
			out of the range of the number of ports. See above for details
		</option>
		<option name="Variable output at port [n]">Whether the output port with the given index [n]
			is replaced with a flow variable port
		</option>

	<ports>
		<inPort
			index="0"
			name="Input">The input port, which can have its type changed</inPort>

		<outPort
			index="0"
			name="Out-Port 0">The first output port. The type can be changed between 'data'
			(which corresponds to the same as the input) and 'flow variable'
		</outPort>
		<outPort
			index="1"
			name="Out-Port 1">The second output port. The type can be either 'data' or 'flow variable' as above
		</outPort>
		<dynOutPort
			insert-before="1"
			name="Additional output ports"
			group-identifier="More Outputs">Additional output ports. The type can be either
			'data' or 'flow variable' as above (this can be changed in the
			node dialog)
