	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			A configurable IF/CASE switch with changeable port types and varying
			number of output ports, and corresponding variable conditions. Output
			ports can be replaced with Flow Variable ports where required.

			All
			outputs except the first for which the corresponding condition
			evaluates to 'true' will be inactive. Output ports can be either
			'Data' or 'Flow Variable'. If 'Data' is selected, the port type will
			be the same as the input
