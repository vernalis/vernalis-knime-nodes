	<name>Configurable Empty Table Switch</name>

	<shortDescription>
        This node provides an IF switch which passes the 1st input port as an active if it has 
        rows, and the second if the first table is empty
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>If the first input table has one or more rows, then this is passed
				out to the first, active output port, and the second port is
				inactive.
			</p>
			<p>If, however, the first input port contains an empty table, then
				the second port is passed to the second, active output port, and
				the
				first output port is in active.
			</p>
			<p>The type of the second port can be changed</p>
