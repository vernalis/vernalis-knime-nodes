		Loop end node to handle 1 or more input ports

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Node at the end of a loop. It is used to mark the end of a workflow
			loop and collects the intermediate results by row-wise
			concatenation
			of the incoming tables. The start of the loop is defined by the loop
			start node, in which you can define how often
			the loop should be
			executed (either fixed or derived from data, e.g. the
			"group loop
			start"). All nodes in between are executed
			that many times.

		<option name="Ignore empty input tables at port ...">Selecting this option means the structure of empty
