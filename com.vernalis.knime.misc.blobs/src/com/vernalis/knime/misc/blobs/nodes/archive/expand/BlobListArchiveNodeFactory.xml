                Compressed files and archives can be exploited
                by
                attackers using carefully crafted files which can
                cause
                issues on expansion, either by generating
                extremely large
                files from a small compressed file, or
                by generating
                large numbers of files from an innocuously
                small looking
                file. The following settings. See the Wikipedia article

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bomb</a>
                ' for further details. The default settings here should
                be suitable to extract most files whilst limiting attack

                only available

                concatenation

                decompression is detected by any of the settings
                supplied? If not, then a warning will be set and at
                least one row for each input row will be present in the
                table. In the event that the first output row triggered
                the warning, then missing values will be added to the
