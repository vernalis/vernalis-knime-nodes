	<name>Speedy SMILES Enumerate Stereoisomers</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Node to enumerate all isomer combinations of
		explicitly defined stereocentres
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node enumerates all possible options of all explicitly
				defined stereocentres. Where '@' or
				'@@' has been used as shorthand
				for OH1, OH2, TB1 or TB2, they will only be enumerated as the
				partial set
				['@'.'@@']
			</p>
			<p>
				The node has been re-written to avoid memory overflow errors in
				the original version when large numbers of isomers where being
				enumerated. However, enumeration of large numbers of isomers can
				take a very large amount of time. Users are strongly recommended to
				filter input tables after using the 'Speedy SMILES Possible
				Stereoisomer Count' node.
