	<name>Speedy SMILES Clean Bonds</name>


	<shortDescription>
		Node to clean unnecessary bonds.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node cleans unecessary bonds:
				<ul>
					<li>Single bonds - only retained then they are between two aromatic
						atoms
					</li>
					<li>Aromatic bonds - all removed</li>
				</ul>
				This is to comply with the suggestion in OpenSMILES that these bond
				types are implicit, and so the only need for them is for an explicit
				single bond between two aromatic atoms
