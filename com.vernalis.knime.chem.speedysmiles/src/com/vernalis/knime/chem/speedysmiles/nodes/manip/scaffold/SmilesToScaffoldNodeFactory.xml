	<shortDescription>
		Node to convert SMILES strings to a scaffold
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node converts SMILES strings to a scaffold representation. By
				default, all atoms are represented as 'C' (i.e. carbon), and the
				output is a SMILES string. However, when 'Any Atom' ('*' in SMILES)
				is used, and the 'Keep Aromatic atoms aromatic' option is selected,
				then a SMARTS cell is returned, using the SMARTS 'A' and 'a' atoms,
				as these are not valid SMILES. See the individual options below for
				details.
			</p>
			<p>
				NB,
				<i>no canonicalisation of the output is attempted</i>
				, and so if grouping molecules
				by identical scaffold is required,
				then the output should subsequently be passed
				into a toolkit for
				canonicalisation
			</p>

		<option name="Select SMILES column">The SMILES column, containing molecules</option>
		<option name="Remove input columns">If checked, then the input column is removed
		</option>
		<option name="Use 'Any Atom' (* or A/a) symbols">See above for details</option>
		<option name="Keep Explicit H's">Any [H] atoms, or 'D' and 'T' pseudoatoms for [2H]
			and [3H] are preserved. NB no other isotopic, atom class or other
			atom properties are maintained on these atoms, and H's specified as
			e.g [C3H] will be discarded. If this option is not set, then they
			will be treated as any other atom, and so will appear as 'C' or '*'
			in the output.
		</option>
		<option name="Keep Bond Orders">If this option is checked, any bond symbols
			present in the input will be removed in the output (including
			explicit single bonds between aromatic atoms not in rings)
		</option>
		<option name="Keep Aromatic atoms aromatic">An atom represented as aromatic in the SMILES
			(specifically, a lower-case non-bracketed organic subset atom, or a
			bracketed atom starting with a lower case letter - i.e. not just 'as'
			and 'se' as bracketed 2-character elements) will be represented as an
			aromatic 'c' or 'a', otherwise it will be represented as 'C' or 'A'.
			See also above.
		</option>
		<option name="Keep Chirality">If this option is selected, then and '@' chirality
			settings on atoms are preserved (including '@@', '@@@' - the Daylight
			specification is ambiguous as to whether this should be allowed for
			e.g. @OH3 - and the @TH1/@OH1 etc forms)
