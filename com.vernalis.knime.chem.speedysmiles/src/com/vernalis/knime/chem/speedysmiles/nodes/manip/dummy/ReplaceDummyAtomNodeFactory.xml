	<shortDescription>
		Node to replace dummy atoms with an alternative atom
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node replaces dummy atoms with an alternative supplied
				element symbol. No validation of the element symbol is carried out
				beyond removing surrounding '[' and ']' characters, which will be
				reapplied if the dummy atom is not surround with '[' and ']', and
				the replacement is not an organic subset atom. An empty string is
				not a valid replacement
