	<shortDescription>
		Node to cyclise a SMILES string by connecting the
		first and last atom with a new single bond by inserting a ring closure
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node cyclises a SMILES string by connecting the
				first and last
				atom with a new single bond by inserting a ring closure
			</p>
			<p>
				NB No sense-checking is performed, so if the two end atoms are
				already connected, an addition connection will be added, which will
				result in many parsers failing to parse.
			</p>
			<p>
				NB (2) If the 'Remove First Atom' or 'Remove Last Atom' options
				are
				selected, then any bond closures associated with them will also
				be
				removed, resulting potentially in 'dangling' bonds. In this case,
				the node should be followed immediately by a '
				<i>Speedy SMILES Remove Broken Bonds Filter
				</i>
				' node.
			</p>
			<p>NB (3) An invalid SMILES may be produced
				when the 'Remove First
				Atom'
				option is selected by removing an atom which is followed
				by a
				branch,
				e.g. 'C(CC)OC' would become '(CC)OC' - in which case a
				missing cell will be returned
			</p>
			<p>NB (4) The mode will use the first unused ring closure index.
				Formally, SMILES ring closure indices are not supposed to exceed 99,
				although the OpenSMILES definition proposes this as an extension.
				However, in the unlikely even that all 99 indices have been used in
				a SMILES String, then a ring closure index >99 will be used
