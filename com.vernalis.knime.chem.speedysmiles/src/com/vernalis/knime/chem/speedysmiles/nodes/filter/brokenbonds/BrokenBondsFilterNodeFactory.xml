	<name>Speedy SMILES Remove Broken Bonds Filter</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Node to remove rows with broken bonds (i.e. an
		unmatched bond start or end index)
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node removes rows which contain broken bonds, i.e bonds where
				a numeric bond start index has no corresponding end index. This
				situation can occur where (rarely) a single component molecule has
				been rendered as a dot-disconnected SMILES string, e.g. ethane as
				'C1.C1', in which case the SpeedySMILES desalter node will break
				these components apart to 2 'C1' components, each of which contains
				a 'broken' bond
