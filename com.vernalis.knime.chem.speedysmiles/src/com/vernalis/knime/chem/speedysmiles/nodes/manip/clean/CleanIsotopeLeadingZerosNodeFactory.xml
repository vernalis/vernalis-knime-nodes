	<shortDescription>
		Node to clean redundant leading zeros from isotopic
		labels
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node moves cleans leading zeros from isotope labels. As [0Aa]
				is not the same as [Aa] (where Aa is any element), if only zeros are
				present, then last is retained, e.g [001Se] becomes [1Se], [0000H]
				becomes [0H]
