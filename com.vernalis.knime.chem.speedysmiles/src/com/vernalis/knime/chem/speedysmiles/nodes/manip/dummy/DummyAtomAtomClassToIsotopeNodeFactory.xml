	<name>Speedy SMILES Dummy Atom Atom Class to Isotope Label</name>


	<shortDescription>
		Node to move dummy atom atom class labels to isotopes
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node moves dummy atom atom classes to isotopes. Where
				an
				isotope is already present, or an (illegal!) non-numeric atom class
				is present, the atom is left unchanged. e.g.
				[*:3] is converted to
				[3*], but [3*:1] and [*:a] are left unchanged.
