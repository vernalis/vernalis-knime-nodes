	<shortDescription>
		Node to find largest component of SMILES by Heavy
		Atom Count
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node desalts SMILES strings by splitting into their
				individual components and counting the number of heavy atoms in each
				component. The component(s) with the most heavy atoms (HAC) are
				kept. In the event of more the 1 component having the same HAC, then
				the behaviour depends on the Tie-break settings
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>NB</b>
				This is a crude but fast algorithm. Certain cases (e.g. 'C1.C1') may
				give erroneous results. Such cases can be detected using the 'Speedy
				SMILES Remove Broken Bonds' filter or splitter node
			</p>

			<option name="Keep only 1st unique component">If checked, then only a single SMILES component
				will be kept in the case of more than 1 component having the same
				highest
				HAC. The selection will be arbitrarily the first entry in the
				internal
				storage (which may not be the first encountered in the
				string). Otherwise, all the tied components will be returned in a
				collection cell.
			</option>
			<option name="Keep the longest SMILES String">If only keeping 1 component, if this option is
				checked, then the longest SMILES String will be kept in the event of
				more than 1 component having the same highest
				HAC.
