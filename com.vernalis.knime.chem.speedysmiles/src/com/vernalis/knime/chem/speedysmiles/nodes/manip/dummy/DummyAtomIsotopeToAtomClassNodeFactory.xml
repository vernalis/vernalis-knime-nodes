	<shortDescription>
		Node to move dummy atom isotopes to atom class labels
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>This node moves dummy atom isotope labels to atom classes. Where
				an atom class is already present, the atom is left unchanged. e.g.
				[3*] is converted to [*:3], but [3*:1] is left unchanged.
