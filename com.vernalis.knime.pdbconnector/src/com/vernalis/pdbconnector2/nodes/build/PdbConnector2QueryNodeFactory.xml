	<shortDescription>
        Node to generate an advanced RCSB query
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node provides access to the RCSB PDB advanced query
				webservice,
				in an interface which closely follows the web UI at
				<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/search/advanced">https://www.rcsb.org/search/advanced</a>
				Queries comprise nested fields and subgroups (which themselves can
				contain fields / subgroups to an arbitrary depth). The items in each
				field are combined using the indicated logic operator
			</p>
			<p>Fields can be removed by clicking on the 'X' button at the
				left-hand side of the field, and added by clicking the 'Add Field'
				button at the bottom of the relevant group.
			</p>
			<p>Subgroups can be added by clicking the 'Add SubGroup' button at
				the bottom of the relevant parent group panel, and removed by
				clicking the 'Remove Group' button at the bottom of the subgroup.
				The top-most 'parent' group cannot be removed, although it can be
				left empty.
			</p>
			<p>Individual fields can be reset by clicking the 'Clear' button at
				the right-hand side of the field. Clicking on the 'Clear' button at
				the bottom of a subgroup panel removes all fields and subgroups from
				that panel
			</p>
			<p>Queries can be tested by pressing the 'Count' button, either at
				the right-hand side of the field or the bottom of the group panel.
				In either case, the button text is replaced with the count for the
				relevant part of the query (field, subgroup or entire query). The
				button remains unavailable for repeated counting until the query it
				relates to is changed in some way.
			</p>
			<p>Many of the input boxes will provide live drop-downs of possible
				options once text entry has started.
			</p>
			<p>The relationship between Text, Structure and Sequence queries is
				always 'AND'
			</p>
