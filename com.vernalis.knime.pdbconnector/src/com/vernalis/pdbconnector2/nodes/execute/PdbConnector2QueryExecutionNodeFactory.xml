	<shortDescription>
        Node to execute an advanced RCSB query
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node provides access to the
				<a href="https://www.rcsb.org">RCSB PDB</a>
				advanced query
				webservice, running queries which have been generated
				using the 'PDB
				Connector Query Builder' node and optionally 'PDB
				Connector Combine
				Queries' node
			</p>

				This node was developed by
				<a href="https://www.vernalis.com/">Vernalis Research (Cambridge, UK)</a>

		<option name="Return Type">The type of entity to return
		</option>
<option name="Result content type">Whether experimental or computational structures or both are returned</option>
		<option name="Scoring Strategy">The scoring strategy to use. Not all strategies
			make logical sense for all queries.
		</option>
		<option name="Page Size">The number of hits to retrieve with each network
			call. Larger values will use more memory during node execution, but
			result in fewer calls to the remote webservice
		</option>
		<option name="Limit Hits">Should the number of returned hits be limited
		</option>
		<option name="Maximum Hits to return">If the number of hits is limited, then the maximum
			number of hits to return. If the node output is truncated by this
			setting, then a node warning message will be displayed when query execution has completed
		</option>
		<option name="Include JSON in output">Should the raw JSON response from the webservice
			call be included in the output table
		</option>
