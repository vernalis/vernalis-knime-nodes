    <name>PDB SMILES Query</name>

    <shortDescription>
        Node to perform SMILES string queries using the
        PDB smilesQuery webservice
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        <p><b>THIS NODE NO LONGER WORKS AS THE REMOTE WEBSERVICE HAS BEEN SHUTDOWN</b></p>
            <p>
                This node queries the PDB (
                <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/pdb">www.rcsb.org</a>
                ) webservice described briefly
                <a
                    href="https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/software/rest.do#smiles">here</a>
                . The query accepts a SMILES or SMARTS query string, and
                can
                perform a variety of query types:
                <ul>
                    <li>Exact Match</li>
                    <li>Substructure</li>
                    <li>Superstructure</li>
                    <li>Similarity</li>
                </ul>
                If the Similarity option is selected, then the threshold
                value is enabled and used in the query.
            </p>

            <p>The SMILES string is only validated by sending it to the
                service - if the service is unable to correctly
                interpret the
                supplied string, then an execution error will result. The service will
                return a list of chemical components, along with all
                the structures each component is found in, and a number of details
                about the chemical component(s), as specified in the
                node
                dialogue. The second and third output tables provide a sorted list of the
                chemical component and structure IDs respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE</b>
                Queries are sent un-encrypted to the service, and so
                could be intercepted by 3rd parties.
            </p>
