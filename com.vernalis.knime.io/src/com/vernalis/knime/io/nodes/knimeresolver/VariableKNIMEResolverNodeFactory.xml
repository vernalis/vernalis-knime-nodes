	<shortDescription>
		Node to resolve a KNIME URI
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			A flow variable containing a KNIME URI is resolved to its absolute
			path
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>knime://knime.mountpoint/path/to/file - relative to the
						current
						mountpoint (repository) as the workflow
					</li>
					<li>knime://knime.workflow/path/to/file - relative to the current
						workflow
					</li>
					<li>knime://knime.node/path/to/file - relative to the current node
						(NB this will be this 'KNIME URL Resolver' node!)
					</li>
					<li>knime://MOUNT-ID/path/to/file - Absolute path - NB this is
						likely to fail to resolve to a local file path unless the MOUNT-ID
						is 'LOCAL'
					</li>
				</ul>
