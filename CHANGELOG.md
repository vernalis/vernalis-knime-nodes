## v1.11.0 - 07-Jul-2017
This is a major overhaul of the MMP Nodes which has been described at recent Cheminformatics SIGs and the Berlin Spring 2017 UGM.  Many of the original nodes have been deprecated, a number of new nodes and features added, and many of the new nodes are now streamable.

_All Nodes_

* Improved rSMARTS validation
  * Now requires the bond between the two atoms to be both single and acyclic
  * Allows more complex SMARTS atoms matches (including recursive SMARTS)
  * No longer requires the SMARTS to be provided as an rSMARTS - although this is still supported for backwards compatibility
  * No longer requires atoms to be numbers in the SMARTS match

_Filtering (Updated)_
* Updated faster implementation
* Streamable
* Previous versions deprecated

_Fragmentation nodes (UPDATED)_
* Performance improvements

* Performance improvements including parallelisation
* HiLite mapping optionally implemented
* Transforms can be filtered by
* Heavy-Atom-Count change
* Graph distance similarity
* Remove explicit H's from pair output no longer available as an option
* Added option to require attachment points to be attached by single, acyclic bonds in SMARTS pattern

* New 'Reference Table' version of pair generation node implemented, only returning transforms between the rows of the two input tables
* Deprecated older version

_Apply Transforms (NEW)_
* New node to apply table of rSMARTS transforms
* Allows AP-fingerprint environment filtering
* Node Views showing progress, including currently processed transform(s)
* Limited stereochemistry generation handling at present time

## v1.6.0 - 23-Nov-2015
This is a significant update.  No new functionality is provided, but the contribution is fully KNIME 3.0-ready
_General_
* All nodes are now parallelised wherever possible
* All plugins manifests were updated to bind KNIME component versions into range `[3.0.0, 4.0.0)`
* All plugin.xml's had deprecated nodes re-added, and the deprecation flag set
* All plugin.xml's had disused expert-mode property of node extensions removed

_Main Vernalis Plugin_
#### Fingerprint properties Node
* Parallelised execution
* Fingerprint type names no longer end 'Cell', so are `SparseBitVector`, `DenseBitVector`, `SparseByteVector`, `DenseByteVector`
* Test case updated to reflect this change
* Fixed bug - Although the node could process ByteVectors, the column selector does not let it select them

#### FASTA Sequence Node
* Updated all counters for rows and subrows to `long`s

#### EuroPMC Node
* Updated hit, page and row counters to `long`s (flow variables for hit counter may therefore behave strangely)

#### List Dirs node
* Updated file and added row counters to `long`s

#### Load local PDB file node
* Parallelised
* Converted to use `PDBCellFactory`

#### Save local PDB file Node
* Parallelised
* Converted to use `BooleanCellFactory` for result cell

#### PDB Downloader (Manipulator)
* Parallelised
* Converted to use PDBCellFactory

#### PDB Downloader (Source)
* Updated row and PDB ID counters to `long`s (NB this is probably irrelevant as they are processed via arrays!)

#### Load Text files
* Parallelised

#### Save Text files
* Parallelised
* Add logging explanation for save failures where easily possible
* Return value now uses `BooleanCellFactory`

#### Random Number Generator
* Original Version deprecated due to change in settings model type
* Maximum number of rows changed to a `Long` (and Settings Model changed to `SettingsModelLongBounded`), and artificial 10,000 row cap removed
* Row counters changed to `long`s
* Generator methods changed to not work via intermediate collections but add directly, and thus to allow cancelling during number generation as well as table writing, and old methods deprecated
* New Test Case created for new version

#### PDB To Sequence
* Updated to handle long tables

#### PDB Properties
* Parallelised

#### PDB Connector / PDB Connector (XML Query)
* Updated to allow long tables at both outputs


_MMPs Plugin_
* Modified canonicalisation during fragmentation to resolve duplicate leaves canonically (results in possible changes to canonicalisation)
* Converted to `SmilesCellFactory`
* MMP canonicalisation is modified to deal with duplicate components in the 'Key'

_Flow Control Plugin_
* All PortType constructors replaced with `PortTypeRegistry.getInstance().getPortType()` constructors
* Now all use `#size()` in place of `#getRowCount()`
* Iteration counters now all `long` (flow variables for iteration counters may therefore behave strangely)

_Performance Monitoring Plugin_
* Iteration counters now `long` (flow variables for iteration counters may therefore behave strangely)
* Iteration column in timing table now `LongCell` (previously `IntCell`)
