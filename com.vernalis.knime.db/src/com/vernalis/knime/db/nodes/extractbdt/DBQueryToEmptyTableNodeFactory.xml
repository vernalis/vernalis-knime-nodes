		<intro>
			<p>This node generates an empty KNIME table with the columns in a
				database query connection. The database itself is not accessed to
				create the table.
			</p>
			<p>A database query connection contains a database connection with
				SQL query, and additionally a normal data table specification, which
				should represent the table specification when the connection is
				read. This nodes simply creates an empty table with that
				specification without reading the database
