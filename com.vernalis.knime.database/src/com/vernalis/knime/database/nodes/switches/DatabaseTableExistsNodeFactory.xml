		<option name="Table Name">the name of the table to check, which may include
			the namespace. If no namespace is included then the namespace will
			not be checked
		</option>
		<option name="Ignore Case">If this option is selected, then the check will be
			performed in a case-insensitive manner. Otherwise the check is
			subject to the case sensitivity rules implemented in the JDBC
			connector for the database
		</option>
		<option name="Table Type(s)">The table types to check for the table. By
			default, this is restricted to tables and views
		</option>
		<option name="Check availability at Configure">If this option is selected, then the output ports
			are enabled/disabled during configure as well as during node
			execution (the result may be different between those times),
			otherwise the setting is only applied during node execution phase,
			and both ports remain active on the unexecuted node
